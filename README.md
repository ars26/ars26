# Hi, I'm Ars! 

I am a rising senior at the University of Rochester majoring in Computational Biology & Psychology and I am incredibly passionate about using modern tools such as big data analyses and statistics to create policies that impact me and you. 

From interpersonal violence, to police brutality, to voter suppression: I feel that understanding historic trends, analyzing contemporary thinking, and including diverse voices can go a long way in reducing societal inequalities. 

I have been exploring these intersections for quite a while: from researching why a beautiful bird may go extinct in Florida, to how much University students (mis)trust their campus' police, to sexual-identity disclosure in adolescents-- I have come to conclude that data-driven policy-making is the future. 

Please feel free to explore any of my projects, resumes, and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ars26/)!. You can always shoot me an email as well, I am always looking to improve!
